# About-Me-Resume-Portfolio
# Your Project's Name
My project "ASG1 for Interactive Development. About me Resume / Portfolio" is about making a Resume about myself with the main purpose
of trying to market it to employers. In this project it showcases various pages, About Me page, Contacts page, Projects page and Skills
page. 
The About Me page which is essentially the home page, is where i introduce myself with, provide my 
education history and also my results from important exams over the years! It also includes some of
my Values In Actions (VIA) activities.
The Contacts page which provides my contacts, is where my 
employers can find me! This page includes my LinkedIn, Instagram, Email and also my Phone Number!
By providing various methods of contact, my future employers will certainly be able to contact me
without a problem! 
The Projects page is where i showcase my previous Projects and works i have done!
These include my school "Ngee Ann Polytechnic" work and major projects. By showcasing these projects,
it provides my future employers with evidence that i am a hardworking student and one that can definitely
achieve in my future endeavours.
The Skills page will showcase some of my soft and hard skills. Hard skills are skills that are related to
programs, for example, Photoshop or Python Language coding! My soft skills are skills that i have built by
maturing over the past few years. These include, leadership as an example, communication skills and listening skills.

## Design Process
Design thought process!
I created this website with a modernistic-marble type feel. In the different pages, my paragraphs are enlarged
so as to provide the main customer, the employers, with ease of reading. I also bolded some of the important
words i used in my paragraphs to make sure that the employer can read it. I decided to make a modernistic-marble
themed website so as to show that i am not outdated but also keeping up with the trend in my own unique ways, i
feel that the employers viewing this website would feel a little more pleasant when they see my modernistic design!
One of the most crucial components of my design process is my contact page as this page provides a place
where my future employers can contact me via. These contacts are also embedded with a link so all they need to do is just 
click a link/button to contact me! My skills page also shows both my hard and soft skills which i think is essential as
some employers only care about hard skills while some care about both! Lastly, my projects page showcases various pictures of my work
that will catch the eyes of my employers.

User Stories!
As a employer, i would like to have ease in contacting my employee, so if i wanted an immediate reply from a message i have sent, i can use
the mobile number provided for a swifter reply!
As an employer, I would also love to be able to view all my employees work so i can judge whether he or she is talented and whether their
work suits our company! just like their grades have shown!
As an employer, I would like to know about my employees education history, know what he or she looks like and also see a brief introduction
about him/herself so i know what type of employee i am hiring!
As an employer, i would like to see my employees hard and soft skills to determine whether he is the perfect fit for our company!

## Features

-----In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

My projects consists of various features including Navigation bars, Contact Links.
My Navigation bar consists of 4 sections, Home which is the About Me page, Skills, Contact and Projects!
The navigation bar is coded to show which page you are currently on and also shows a change in colour whenever 
your mouse is hovering over something to indicate you are about to select that page!
The contact links is coded so the links are actually embedded into a phrase, for example,
my instagram is instagram.com/cherwei__ while the phrase shows My Instagram!.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
